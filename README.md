### Example

Hereâ€™s an example of how to configure the workflow in your GitHub Actions file to update :

```yaml
name: Update package.json version

on: push

jobs:
  update-package-version:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    permissions:
      contents: write

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Update Package Json version
        uses: iamthenoah/update-json-file@v1
        with:
          file: './package.json'
          key: 'version'
          value: ${{ github.ref_name }}
          branch: 'master'
          message: 'Updated %f version to `%v`'
          name: 'My Workflow'
          email: 'workflow@example.com'
```

## Permissions

This workflow requires elevated permissions in order to commit changes to a repositry. To fix this, add the following in the root of the workflow or job:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write
```

In addition, perform a checkout by passing the github context token:

```yaml
uses: actions/checkout@v4
with:
  token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```
